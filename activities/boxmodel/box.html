        <h2>Q&A</h2>
        <h4>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</h4>
        <p>Block tags take up the full width of the page and start on a new line. While, inline tags only take up as much space as their content and stay in line with other text.</p>
        <h4>What is the margin, border, and padding?</h4>
        <p>Margin is the space outside an element, border is the line around it, and padding is the space inside between the content and the border.</p>
        <h4>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h4>
        <p>CSS units can be absolute like pixels (px) or relative like percent (%), em, rem, vw, and vh.</p>
        <h4>When would you use a figure tag?</h4>
        <p>A figure tag is used to group an image or visual with its caption so they stay together semantically.</p>
