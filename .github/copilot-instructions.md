# Copilot Instructions for CS140 Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository is organized for CS140 coursework. It contains three main directories:

- `activities/`: Contains activity files (e.g., `alpha.html`, `beta.html`, `gamma.html`).
- `projects/`: Contains project files.
- `final/`: Contains final project assignments.

Each directory serves a specific purpose, and files should be placed in their respective folders as per the `README.md` guidelines.

## Key Conventions
1. **File Naming**: Avoid using spaces in file or folder names.
2. **Folder Structure**:
   - Activities go in the `activities/` folder.
   - Projects go in the `projects/` folder.
   - Final assignments go in the `final/` folder.

## Development Patterns
- **HTML Files**: The repository primarily contains HTML files. Each file should follow standard HTML5 conventions.
- **Content Organization**: Ensure that the content in HTML files is well-structured and uses semantic tags appropriately.

## Example File
Here is an example of an HTML file from the `activities/` folder:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Gamma</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>How do you organize a space party?</h1>
    <p>You planet. :)</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Suggestions for AI Agents
- When creating new files, ensure they are placed in the correct directory (`activities/`, `projects/`, or `final/`).
- Follow the file naming conventions strictly to maintain consistency.
- Use semantic HTML and ensure proper indentation for readability.

## Additional Notes
- This repository does not currently include build or test workflows.
- Focus on maintaining a clean and organized structure as per the `README.md` instructions.
