        <h2>My Hero - Uncle Iroh</h2>
        <p>Uncle Iroh is a hero because he chooses wisdom, kindness, and peace over power and conquest. Despite being a retired general of the Fire Nation, he is a pacifist who values harmony and understanding above all else. He also loves tea, relaxation, and the simple pleasures of life. Uncle Iroh shows that heroism can also come from love, long-suffering and doing good without expecting something in return.</p>
