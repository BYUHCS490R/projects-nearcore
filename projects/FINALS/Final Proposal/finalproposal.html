            <p><strong>Title:</strong> The Culinary Compass</p>
            <p><strong>Topic:</strong> A website where people can share, look up, and save their favorite home-cooked meals, focusing on simple and diverse recipes.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">2. Project Rationale (Brief Paragraph)</h3>
            <p>I picked "The Culinary Compass" because I want to build a useful site that helps bring people together through food. Most recipe sites are hard to use or focus on expensive meals. My goal is to create a clean, easy-to-use site where people can share simple, beloved family recipes. This will be a great resource for students and anyone learning to cook. This project lets me practice using forms, tables, and multiple pages, which is exactly what we've been learning in class.</p>

            <p>Most of my website content (recipes, descriptions) will be written by me, using my own cooking knowledge and family recipes. This is to make sure everything is original and I don't break any rules about copying. All pictures will come from free-to-use image sites (like Pexels or Unsplash) or pictures I take myself. I will make sure to give credit for every image used at the bottom of the page, as required.</p>

            <ul class="references-list">

                <li><strong>Reference 3:</strong> General cooking reference books for measurement data (e.g., standard cookbook measurement charts).</li>
