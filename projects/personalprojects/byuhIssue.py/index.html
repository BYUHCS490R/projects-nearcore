                <h2>The Current Obstacle</h2>
                <p>
                    [cite_start]A policy must be established within the university that ensures mandatory university events do not interfere with the APCC Career Fair[cite: 6]. [cite_start]Currently, students face a difficult choice: attend the necessary job fair to benefit their future, or attend class to avoid academic penalties[cite: 10].
                </p>
                <p>
                    [cite_start]This action is necessary to prevent the valuable resource the university offers from being wasted and to help all students realize the true value that the APCC represents[cite: 7].

                <h3>The Solution: A "Blackout Period"</h3>
                <p>
                    [cite_start]My hope is that this proposal will serve as the groundwork for establishing a university policy that prohibits any professor from holding mandatory classes, assignments, or deadlines that must be attended or turned in within the hours of the APCC Career Fair[cite: 9].
                </p>
                [cite_start]<p><strong>Clarification:</strong> I do not request classes be canceled, but rather that protection be provided against assignments and attendance requirements[cite: 26].</p>

                        [cite_start]<p>The cost of recruiting foreign companies for the Career Fair is wasted if qualified students are unable to attend[cite: 19]. We must maximize the return on this investment.</p>

                <p>
                    [cite_start]My goal is for this university to eliminate the existing obstacle, allowing students to choose to attend this necessary job fair without facing consequences[cite: 10]. [cite_start]Let us preserve the integrity of the Career Fair and ensure student commitment is honored[cite: 14].
