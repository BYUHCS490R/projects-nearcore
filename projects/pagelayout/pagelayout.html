            <h2>What is Paradis?</h2>
            <p>Paradis Island is a large and isolated land surrounded by the sea. It is home to the Eldian people who live within three enormous walls that protect them from Titans, giant humanoid creatures that roam outside. The island has a mix of landscapes, including forests, plains, rivers, and mountain ranges, giving it both natural beauty and danger.</p>

            <p>Because of the constant threat of Titans, most people never leave the safety of the walls.The Eldians believe they are the last remaining humans in the world, unaware that other surviving and thriving nations exist beyond their island. The three circular walls, named Maria, Rose, and Sina, divide the island into layers of safety and settlement. The innermost areas are more developed and secure, while the outer regions are rural and face greater danger from Titan attacks. Beyond the walls lies a wide stretch of wild land that reaches the coast, filled with forests and the ruins of abandoned towns. Though rich in nature, Paradis Island feels confined and cut off from the world, as its people live in fear of Titans and in ignorance of the true size and life of the world beyond the sea.</p>
