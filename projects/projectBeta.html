    <h1>Mark Nephi Javier</h1>
    
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">I was born in the early years of the 2nd Millenia A.D. While growing up in the north of the <strong>Philippines</strong>, I became fluent in speaking <em>Ilocano</em>, the third-most spoken language of the nation. I was never much of an extrovert, preferring quiet corners over bustling rooms, and something of a night owl, finding peace and imagination in the quiet of late evenings. The combination of quiet days and insomnia-haunted nights instilled me with the habit of perceiving the world in earnest, making me contemplative and interested in the little things that others don't see.</p>
    
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">As a younger person, my thoughts strayed with infinite aspirations. I once aspired to be an inventor, developing machines and devices that could transform lives. Once again, I wanted to be a Pokémon Master, catching all the creatures that I could dream of. I also wanted to be a soldier, powerful and courageous, and even to be able to run as fast as the running machines that I could see zooming down the roads.  Each of these aspirations bore with it part of that thrill and awe I had for all the possibilities of life.</p>
    
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Today, I study computer science, business, and Chinese, developing skills that I hope will lead me to a future of being able to start up a business that does good for people. I hope to travel to foreign countries, particularly <strong>Japan</strong>, <strong>China</strong>, and <strong>Korea</strong>, to learn their cultures and take in their ideas. I also still even enjoy playing games the most, particularly The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, a world of adventure in that I can explore, build, and escape. One of my aspirations is to be able to share that passion for gaming with my future kids, sharing with them the same adventures and legends that to date inspire me. Those games are primarily the following…</p>
